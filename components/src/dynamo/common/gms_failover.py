    Inter-pod failover replacement pods can reuse pod index 0 after a failover,
    while the active holder is now index 1. Static primary-index checks would
    make that replacement block forever without quiescing. The lock is the
    source of truth: if it is free, this worker is active; if it is busy, this
    worker must become a warm shadow and wait.
