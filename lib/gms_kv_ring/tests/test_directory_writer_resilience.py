"""The async directory publish worker must not die on a single mutation failure.

A transient daemon error -- or this engine being fenced/demoted mid-drain --
previously set a fatal error, cleared the queue and stopped the worker thread,
silently ending ALL future directory publications for the process. That is a
permanent prefix-cache-publishing cliff. The worker must instead skip the failed
mutation (a safe cache miss) and keep serving the queue.
